### Fixed some settings of Paragraph Config of Pattern Based Cropper that were not working

In Pattern Based Cropper, fixed these two settings which were not being considered by cropper:
  1. **Questions  Config -> Paragraph Questions -> Crop -> Exactly To**'s left and right settings.
  2. **Questions  Config -> Paragraph Questions -> Crop -> Offset By -> top coordinate**.

Now those two will work as intended.
