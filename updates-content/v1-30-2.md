### Fixed an issue in Test Interface

Fixed a bug that occurred when **Save Questions Like Real Exams** was enabled (set to "Yes").
On revisiting a question that was **Marked for Review** or **Answered & Marked for Review**, the question status incorrectly changed to **Not Answered** or **Answered**.

Now it works as intended.
